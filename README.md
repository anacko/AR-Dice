# AR-Dice
A simple page to show dice with AR.

## Starting point
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file. Insert the correct information.
- Run the server with `npm start`. Port 3000 is the default.
- Allow camera access.
- Show the Kanji marker. The expectation is to see a 6-sided die animation.
